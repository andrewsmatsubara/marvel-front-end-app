# Printi Front End Technical Test

## Description

This is a process which tests the candidates to develop a application that calls Marvel's API to render characters information inside pages whether the user puts the correct API access key. The application is fully developed with ReactJS for page and component creation and Redux for state management.

The most challenging part of the test was not using create-react-app and creating the application from scratch. That made the development process harder because of many inconscistencies faced during certain commands. But re-learning Redux was one of that parts either!

## How To Install And Run The Project

To install the project's dependencies run 'npm install' inside the project folder. Running the project is as easy than that! Just hit 'npm start' in your terminal, always inside the project folder(after installing the dependencies).

## Usage Of Application

Put a valid Marvel's API private and public access key. Then the user will be redirected to a characters list page. Inside that page, characters names are clickable and if the user do so, another page displays with that characters informations.
